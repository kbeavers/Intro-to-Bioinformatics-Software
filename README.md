# Introduction to Bioinformatics Software on HPC Clusters

Documentation for HPC administrators and staff who run or support clusters and want to become familiar with common bioinformatics tools and workflows. The material covers how these workloads behave on HPC (CPU, memory, 
I/O) and how to run them efficiently with SLURM and Biocontainers/Singularity/Apptainer.

## What's covered

- **Introduction** — Overview, learning objectives, and assumptions
- **Data acquisition** — SRA Toolkit (prefetch, fasterq-dump) for downloading public sequencing data; HPC considerations and examples (single run, batch)
- More material in progress
